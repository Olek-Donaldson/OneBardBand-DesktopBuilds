    For Mac, extracting from the zip folder should simply give you the application itself. Run it and have fun!
    For Windows (32-bit & 64-bit) and Linux, extracting the zip folder should give you a regular folder of the same name. Open that folder and run the “One Bard Band” Application (for Windows it’s the .exe file, and for Linux it’s the x86_64 file). Have fun!
