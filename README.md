 ### **Instructions for downloading and running:**
 <ol>
 <li>Download zip file pertaining to your Operating System</li>
 <li>Extract zip folder</li>
 <li>Running the application:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>For Mac, extracting from the zip folder should simply give you the application itself. If attempting to run the application gives you an error like this:
    <img src="readme-images/unknown-dev.png" alt = "Unidentified developer error"/> 
    Right-click (or Control + click) on the application, and select "Open" from the context menu. You will get a similar pop up, but this time with an option to Open the application regardless. Have fun!</li>
    <li>For Windows (32-bit & 64-bit) and Linux, extracting the zip folder should give you a regular folder of the same name. Open that folder and run the “One Bard Band” Application (for Windows it’s the .exe file, and for Linux it’s the x86_64 file). Have fun!</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

![Battle](readme-images/battle.png)

For battle, we recommend placing your hands on the keyboard in traditional typing position, with your index fingers resting on the F and J keys.

When a note reaches the red/pink bar on the left, press the corresponding key to play the note and attack! You'll take damage for any notes you miss! Some Pan Flute notes have a colored bar trailing behind them, meaning the notes are sustained. Press and hold the key to continue paying the note for it's full duration.
